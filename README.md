 Fun Calculator! 🎉
Welcome to the Fun Calculator! This simple Python script allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to use, perfect for quick calculations!

✨ Features
Addition: Calculates the sum of two numbers.

Subtraction: Finds the difference between two numbers.

Multiplication: Computes the product of two numbers.

Division: Determines the quotient of two numbers.

Decimal Support: Uses float to handle numbers with decimal points.

User-Friendly Prompts: Guides the user through inputting numbers.

🚀 How to Use
Save the Code:
Save the provided Python code into a file named calculator.py (or any other .py extension).

# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? ✨
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 🧙‍♂️
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! 🧠 Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!) ➕
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary! 😜) ➖
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck! 💥) ✖️
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second (Be careful with zero here, no math disasters! 😅) ➗
# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now!
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Show the user what we got! 🥳 Time for the big reveal! 🎉
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ➖
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ✖️
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ➗

# 🏁 And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎💻

Run from Terminal:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using Python:

python calculator.py

Follow the Prompts:
The script will then ask you to enter the first number, then the second number. After you provide both inputs, it will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0

Enjoy your Fun Calculator! 😎
